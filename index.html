    Cairo talks about how looking at data with different visuals and charts gives a whole new meaning about the data represented. He explains how a histogram provides a good insight about the deviations from the mean, whereas the strip plot represents the data in a more functional manner.

   Furthermore, he talks about how one outlier can immensely change the value of the data we receive; therefore, we should be careful to consider the outliers and choose a statistic that represents the data best. In addition, he explains how a good visual designer will never rely on one chart or statistic to make his conclusions.

    For instance, he talked about the average salaries of graduates from UNC, most of them had a salary below $40000, but because of one exception, a graduate who had a salary of 5 million, the mean jumped up to $740000. This does not represent the data well enough so we should carefully observe the discrepancies in the data and analyze it to represent the data in a more meaningful way.

    It can be seen in figure one than the values are not very far from the norm, whereas in figure two one exception causes the mean to rise a lot, due to which the value of the mean is not a good representation of the data for figure two.
